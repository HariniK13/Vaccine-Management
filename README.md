# Vaccine-Management
Vaccine Management System using C++(File Handling)

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to design a Vaccine Management System for storing and retrieving vaccination data. The system should be as flexible as possible so that it can be used for different hospitals vaccination centre. You have to find out which procedures have used for different vaccination centre. You have to find out which procedures hospitals have and based on that information, you should create a system which makes it efficient. You need to find out how a hospital system works on the internet, use your own experience or directly talk to people in the hospital vaccination centre.

# Abstract
The vaccine management system, is software that handles all the data 
related to vaccination. The data contains the name of the persons who have taken the vaccine and also tells the current status of vaccine availability. Previously the task of handling the vaccination data was very difficult, so there was a need for software that can handle all the vaccination data. 

# Approach
The vaccine management system is software that handles all the data related to vaccination. The data contains the name of the persons who have taken the vaccine and also tells the current status of the vaccine availability. previously the task of handling the vaccination data was very difficult, so there was a need for software that can handle all the vaccination data.
Therefore the Vaccine Management System was designed. After the release of this system, the stress and workload of employees were absolutely finished. It was also time-wasting for the employees to handle the whole vaccination data with the help of a notebook. But now it hardly takes 5 to 10 minutes to search the vaccination status of a particular person. 
Only Admin is able to login into the software. Admin has to enter the username, password and the captcha before accessing the data. The Project use the concept of file handling to store the vaccination data. Admin is able to create a new record of vaccination. All the vaccination status can be viewed at a time. There is a separate feature of search where admin can search a particular person very quickly. The entire rights are given to the admin for adding, searching and viewing the data.
